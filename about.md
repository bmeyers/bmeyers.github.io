Hello! My name is Bennet Meyers. I'm a Project Scientist with [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/) and a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. My PhD advisor is [Stephen Boyd](http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/). I am interested in machine learning, signal processing, and data mining and their applications in the energy sector. I am particularly interested in developing new analytical tools for processing and gaining insight from solar PV data sets. If you like what you see, feel free to contact me!
