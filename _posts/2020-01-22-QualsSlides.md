Optimal signal demixing (OSD) is an approach to solving structured [signal separation problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_separation). I presented my research on this topic for my PhD qualifying exam in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University in October 2019. I am hosting the slides here, in advance of a coming paper on this topic in the next year.
