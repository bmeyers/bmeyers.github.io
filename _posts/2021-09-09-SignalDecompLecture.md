_My first public lecture on the generalized signal decomposition framework I've been working on_

Wow, it's been a while since I've posted here! I'm going to make an effort to start putting some more actual research notes on this blog again, but in the mean time, here is a talk I gave on April 24, 2021 on signal decomposition. This talk was part of the [SLAC AI Seminar series](https://ml.slac.stanford.edu/ai-seminar).
