I"®<p>Hello! My name is Bennet Meyers. Iâ€™m a Project Scientist with <a href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/">SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory</a> and a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. My PhD advisor is <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/">Stephen Boyd</a>. I am interested in machine learning, signal processing, and data mining and their applications in the energy sector. I am particularly interested in developing new analytical tools for processing and gaining insight from solar PV data sets. If you like what you see, feel free to contact me!</p>
