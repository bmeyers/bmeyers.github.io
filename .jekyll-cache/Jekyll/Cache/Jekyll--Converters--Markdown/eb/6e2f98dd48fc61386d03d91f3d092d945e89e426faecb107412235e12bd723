<p>Optimal signal demixing (OSD) is an approach to solving structured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_separation">signal separation problems</a>. I presented my research on this topic for my PhD qualifying exam in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. I am hosting the slides here, in advance of a coming paper on this topic in the next year. Slides are available <a href="http://localhost:4000/assets/BennetMeyers_Quals_Presentation_2019.pdf">here</a>. I have also started building a modeling language, written in Python, for solving these problems. You can find the GitHub repo <a href="https://github.com/bmeyers/optimal-signal-demixing/">here</a>.</p>
